Visual-Basics-Pong-Game
=======================

I cant believe this survived all these years.... (This is way before .Net) My dad wouldnt let me use the internet. He said I wanted to play games on the computer so i programmed pong for myself to prove to my dad I wanted the internet to program "hacks" FOR games.
